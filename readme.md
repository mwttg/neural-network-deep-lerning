# A simple Neural Network and Deep Learning

## Description

A simple neural network for recognizing handwritten digits implemented in Java.
This repository is based on the online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning][book] by [Michael Nielsen][michael_nielsen].
For training the network the [MNIST dataset][mnist_dataset] is used. 
Unfortunately the link to the original dataset http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ is broken at the moment.

## Requirements

|        | Version |
|--------|---------|
| JDK    | 21      |
| Maven  | 3.9.6   |
